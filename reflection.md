What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Something didn't went well in the beginning and needs an extra eye on was setting the attributes(and/or the methods, it's the same thinking process) of a certain class. It's useful and essential to think from the ending, the target, back to the starting point. Because this way you really know what's important to the class and what attributes should be created, what method should be created. In this assignment, it's about looking at the Procedural_resale_shop, but in other assignments, it's also important to think from the ending.
